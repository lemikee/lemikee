### Hi there, I'm Mike ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack engineer with a focus on React/Redux, Python/Django, and Ruby on Rails.

As a Private Equity Analyst turned full-stack software engineer, I enjoy using React/Redux, Javascript, Python, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS to build responsive projects that scale. I'm always learning new technologies and most recently learned the MERN stack and led a team to build an innovative job matching app, blindr, all in one week.

##### Background
As an Applied Mathematics graduate from UC Berkeley, I was driven to solve complex problems by writing rigorous mathematical proofs. I enjoyed the challenge of having to continually learn new tools to formulate efficient solutions. As an undergraduate, I washed dishes in the dining halls to pay tuition and eventually progressed to starting my own IT support business. Having built the business from the ground up, I wanted to learn from others how to scale and run businesses at the highest levels. As a Private Equity Analyst, I founded and led a team to drive over $50M+ in aggregate deal flow, with the mission to help amazing companies sustainable scale and grow. Now, as a software engineer, I'm able to leverage my prior experience to help deliver efficient and powerful solutions through code.
